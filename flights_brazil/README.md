# Network analysis on the dataset of flights from Brazil

In this repository, a study of the Brazilian air network is carried out through network analysis. Network science seeks to understand complex systems by inspecting the relationships and iterations between their components <sub>[1]</sub>. With the help of the networkX package, the properties of these networks are extracted in order to understand how airports relate to each other and from different regions of Brazil.

## Assortativity
In a nutshell, assortivity is a metric that seeks to quantify how much the network components are related based on their similar attributes. That is, whether elements with similar characteristics tend to relate more.
